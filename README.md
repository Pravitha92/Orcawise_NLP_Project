# Orcawise NLP Project

## Relation Extraction
In this project, our focus is on uncovering **named entity relations (NER)** within the data, leading to the extraction of valuable insights and knowledge. We achieve this by employing both a pre-defined model (StanfordOpenIE) and a fine-tuned model (CustomBertModel). Our primary goal is to extract relations from sentences, specifically targeting four key relationships: managerOf, employedBy, locatedAt, and noRelation.
